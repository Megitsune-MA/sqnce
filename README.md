# sqnce
A basic sequence calculator

**NOTE: sqnce is still in development. Some things are not guarenteed to work and are not implemented yet**

sqnce is a basic sequence calculator that can calculate the common difference. If you've used Lines before, then you'll be familiar with sqnce as though sqnce is very similar to Lines, but **NOT** based on the same code (Lines is written in C++ while sqnce is written in Python).
